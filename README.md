# Number-Base-Converter
JetBrains Academy project in 4 stages

### Stage 1/4: Convert decimals

Learn the basics of input and output to implement a simple logic: teach the program to convert the user input number to binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems. 

### Stage 2/4: Convert to decimal

Practice loop, function, and string processing and give your program new functionality: converting user input numbers to the decimal system. Also, add commands to determine what the program should do next. 

### Stage 3/4: Convert to any base

Upgrade your converter: enable it to convert numbers between any numeral systems. While you're at it, master loops and learn how to store large numbers. 

### Stage 4/4: Convert fractions

Make it possible for the converter to work with fractions, especially with large fractional numbers.
